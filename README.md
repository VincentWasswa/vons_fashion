# Composer template for Drupal projects
## Package features
### Asset packagist support
The Asset packagist package acts as a bridge between Composer and the popular NPM and Bower repositories, which catalog
thousands of useful front-end and JavaScript packages. This allows developers to easily pull in packages like DropZoneJS
and many others without requiring local Node.js to be installed.

### Guardr core security
Guardr is a Drupal distribution with a combination of modules and settings to enhance a Drupal application's security
and availability to meet enterprise security requirements. This project leverages Guardr's package management and
module configuration.

### Sub-profile support
A Drupal core patch has been included to add support for "Sub-profiles".

See: https://www.drupal.org/node/1356276

### Rain base profile features
The [Mediacurrent Rain base install profile](https://bitbucket.org/mediacurrent/mis_rain/) includes many of the most
common packages pre-configured for rapid site development and optional content features.

## Setting up a [DDEV-Local](https://ddev.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) environment

### Clone this repository into the directory of your choice:
- `$ git clone git@github.com:Matt-Hood/vons_fashsion.git`

### Install composer on host machine
If you haven't already, install composer:

- On MacOS ```brew install composer```
- Otherwise, see instructions here https://getcomposer.org/

### Build & Start the local environment

- `$ cd vons_fashsion.git`
- `$ ddev start`
- `$ ./scripts/build.sh`

This script automates the following steps:

* Runs composer install
* Installs the project Drupal site

The initial pass of the build script downloads several dependencies and an intermittent internet connection will affect the initial build process.

### Troubleshooting
* Ensure ddev has started without errors. Correct errors before proceeding.

## Initial Configuration

### Rename & configure sample 'mis_profile' install profile for continued project development
- Change this to the name of your project name ( Copy contrib/mis_profile directory to custom/profilename)
- Find and replace all instances of 'mis_profile' with your project name
- Enable desired base profile features and modules (see mis_profile.install for more instructions).
Note: This command will assist the above steps: `./scripts/hobson project:create-profile --name="example"`

## Logging In
* Use `ddev drush uli` to login to your local installation.

## 5. Adding the sync folder to be used with new installs
* Confirm the sync directory in settings.php. This should be done in the sites/default/settings.php file.
Example:
`
$settings['config_sync_directory'] = '../config/sync';`

* Export configuration ( drush config:export)
* Add the existing-config option to site-install in scripts/build.sh `CMD="site:build -Dexisting_config"`
* Run ./scripts/build.sh to test

## Development Settings
* The settings.local.php file contains settings for customizing the development environment.  This disables Drupal's built in caching and additionally activates sites/development.services.yml for further customizing the development environment.

# Development Workflow

* [Use Composer](https://www.drupal.org/docs/develop/using-composer/using-composer-to-manage-drupal-site-dependencies#managing-contributed) to add 3rd party dependencies and patches.
* Write custom modules, themes etc. to the ./web/ directory.
* Run `ddev drush cex` to export Drupal configuration to the profile/profilename/config/sync folder.
* Run `$ ./scripts/build.sh` before starting a new ticket. Run build.sh again to test work completed prior to submitting a pull request.

## Demo Content
* TBD

## Tests

### Run coding standards tests.

*NOTE* Tests will not run until modules are in the "web/modules/custom" directory.

- phpcs - `./tests/code-sniffer.sh ./web`
- phpcbf - `./tests/code-fixer.sh ./web`

### Drupal-check custom development for 10 readiness.

*NOTE* Checks will not run until modules are in the "web/modules/custom" directory.

- `./vendor/mediacurrent/ci-tests/tests/drupal-check.sh web`

### Run BDD tests.

- `ddev . tests/behat/behat-run.sh https://example.ddev.site`

### Run phpunit tests.

- unit tests - `composer robo test:phpunit-tests`
- kernel and functional tests - `ddev composer robo test:phpunit-tests -- --filter="/Kernel|Functional/"`

### Run VRT.

* Documentation in tests/visual-regression/README.md
* Start at "Quick Start with Docker"

### Run a11y tests.

*NOTE* Requires [pa11y](https://github.com/pa11y/pa11y#command-line-interface)

- `./tests/pa11y/pa11y-review.sh https://example.ddev.site`

### OWASP Zap Baseline Scan.

- `docker run --net=ddev_default -v $(pwd):/zap/wrk/:rw -t owasp/zap2docker-weekly zap-baseline.py -d -c owasp-zap.conf -p owasp-zap-progress.json -t https://ddev-<projectname>-web`

### GrumPHP

* [GrumPHP](https://github.com/phpro/grumphp) will run some tests on code to be committed. The file grumphp.yml is used to configure.
	* Coding Standards
	* Deny committing a list of debug keywords
	* json and yaml linting
	* Composer lock file validation
	* Enlightn Security Checker

### How can I apply patches to downloaded modules?

If you need to apply patches (depending on the project being modified, a pull
request is often a better solution), you can do so with the
[composer-patches](https://github.com/cweagans/composer-patches) plugin.

To add a patch to drupal module foobar insert the patches section in the extra
section of composer.json:

```
"extra": {
    "patches": {
        "drupal/foobar": {
            "Patch description": "URL or local path to patch"
        }
    }
}
```

### How do I specify a PHP version ?

This project supports PHP 7.3 as minimum version (see Environment requirements of Drupal 9), however it's possible that a composer update will upgrade some package that will then require PHP 7.3+.

To prevent this you can add this code to specify the PHP version you want to use in the config section of composer.json:

```
"config": {
    "sort-packages": true,
    "platform": {
        "php": "7.3.19"
    }
},
```
